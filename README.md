This is a Next.js project built with the new app router architecture. 

## Setup
Install dependencies with Yarn (this assumes you already have Yarn installed):
```bash
yarn
```

## Development
Start the Next.js development server, for live-reload support and more:
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Hosting
First, build the production bundle:
```bash
yarn build
```

Then run the production Next.js server:
```bash
yarn start
```

Note that the default listen port is 3000, and can be configured with the -p
argument.
